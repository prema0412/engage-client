      <p>We at Engage believe that for every human being, constructive engagement with the world is what keeps us alive.</p>
      <p>Any physical, mental, emotional, social, geographical boundary or construct or conditioning which prevents us from engaging with the world in the ways we choose to engage at every moment, every hour, every day shall cease to exist.</p>
      <p>In our understanding there are multitude of ways and purposes for which individuals and entities may choose to engage with and we may be aware of some of them - short term, long term, part time, full time, event based, project based, professional, personal, educational. If you know some- more please add them.</p>
      <p>Let us also recognize that an individual has immense potential and in an organic environment it can manifest as deep interest in one or more areas at various points in an average life span of a century.</p>
      <p>Let us use engage to generate immense opportunities for all to remain organically engaged whenever they want, where ever they want, how so ever they want. Help evolve this platform to showcase the best that the world has to offer.</p>
